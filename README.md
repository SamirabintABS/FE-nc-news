# NC News 
## Welcome to the frontend of Northcoders News!ðŸ‘‹ ðŸ“°

This app is one of my front-end based projects on the Northcoders Bootcamp. It is a news application, like Reddit, which allows users to view and engage with news articles. 

This project uses: React.js, SASS, Bootstrap and Axios to make requests to my News API.

Link to my [backend repository!](https://github.com/SamirabintABS/nc-news-backend)

Note: the backend API is hosted on a free web service so the news articles may take a few minutes to render when you first view the app. 
## Setup

If you would like to run the application locally, follow the steps below:

1. Navigate to where you would like to copy the repository in your terminal then run `git clone https://github.com/SamirabintABS/FE-nc-news.git`.

2. `cd FE-nc-news` to change directory to the cloned repository

3. Run `npm install` to install the necessary packages

4. Run `npm start` to view the app in the browser. It will run on localhost:3000 as default if you are not running anything else locally. 

## Minimum Version Requirements

    Node.js v16.13.2
